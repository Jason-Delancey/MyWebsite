  <h2>Chapter 1 - Super Size Me</h2>

  <p>(picture of a fat baby goes here)</p>
  <p>Though it may not show as much now (I hope no), I was a very chunky baby. I don't remember
    much about my childhood but one thing is quite apparent here. I loved to eat. Ever since then,
    my best friend has been, and will always be, my big brother.</p>

  <p>And now comes the epic chapter of Columbia. Honestly, I never thought I could get in. I
    applied to NYU-Stern, Cornell University, and Baruch College as a contingency plan. NYU told me
    no within about 2 weeks of me applying. It was a bit discouraging since my top picks were Ivy
    League. But, it all worked out in the end.</p>
